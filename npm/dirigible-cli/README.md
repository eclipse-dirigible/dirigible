**Eclipse Dirigible CLI**

A powerful command-line interface tool to streamline the development and management of
your [Eclipse Dirigible](https://github.com/eclipse-dirigible/dirigible) projects.

## ðŸš€ Overview

The `@dirigiblelabs/dirigible-cli` package is the essential external utility for developers working with **Eclipse
Dirigible**. It abstracts the complexity of common development tasks, allowing you to interact with and manage your
projects directly from your terminal using a single command: `dirigible`.

The CLI helps in developing Eclipse Dirigible projects by providing **useful commands** for typical development
workflows.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

There are two primary ways to install and use the Dirigible CLI: globally for system-wide access, or locally as a
development dependency for project-specific use.

### 1. Global Installation (Recommended for CLI Tools)

Install the CLI globally using `npm` to run the `dirigible` command directly from any directory in your terminal.

```shell
npm install -g @dirigiblelabs/dirigible-cli
```

### 2. Local Project Dependency

Install the CLI as a development dependency if you prefer to manage it per-project.

```shell
npm install --save-dev @dirigiblelabs/dirigible-cli
```

When installed locally, you can access the command using `npx` (e.g., `npx dirigible <command>`) or by registering
scripts in your `package.json`.

**Example of registering a script:**

```json
// package.json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "start": "dirigible start"
  }
}
```

You can then execute the script using:

```shell
npm run start
```

## ðŸ’¡ Usage

The CLI is invoked using the single command `dirigible`.

### Check All Commands

To see a comprehensive list of all supported commands, arguments, and options, execute the built-in help command:

```shell

```

This will output detailed information on how to use each feature of the CLI.
